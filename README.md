# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker

Description: This project was designed to improve upon an MIT bus stop API. It shows the bus stops in a specific route that go to and from the MIT campus. Each bus is updated every 15 seconds to show their location. And icons for the busses are colored and pointing in the direction they're going. I added the directional icons for the buses, the borders, backround, and all the css.

How to run: Start a new project at "console.cloud.google.com" to get an API key for google maps. Copy all the files in the repo. Open the html file up in your browser.

Future improvements: Some additional features I wanted to include were the Bus ID's when hovering over the icons. A legend could be useful. The times when busses are getting to certain stops would be a nice feature
